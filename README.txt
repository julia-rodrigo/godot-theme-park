Group Project - theme park - by members of Group L

This project was made through each of the contribution from all members in Group L.
I worked on the backend and the piecing all elements together to make everything worked.
Animations of objects, environment layouts, blender models are all made by the other remaining members.
The player character sprite is also made by me.

The report outlines our contributions as a team and the issues we found.

When the code is ran on the computer, it will not work on the environment unless you have a VR headset
There is an Android / Ios export of the game project depending on your device.
There are videos of the project working on both phones respectively to demonstrate the project

This project was designed from the brief in CS424 module of our course
